====================
This is a page title
====================

Here is some text on a page.

Now, let's have a code-block directive with no language...

.. code-block::

   export HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN="<access-token>"
   export ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection-string>"

And some more page text after the code block.

For funzies, let's add one with a language...

.. code-block:: shell

   dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver

And some more words after the code block directive.
