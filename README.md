## Commands (Incomplete List)

### Readability

The `getReadabilityText` command takes file paths as arguments, delimited
by spaces. Pass in a snooty.toml with the flag `--snootyTomlPath`.

This command parses traverses nodes in each file to convert the rst to plain
text. It outputs the plain text for each file as a new file in an `output`
directory, using the same name and directory structure as the input path.

For example, an rST file at `test/delete-a-realm.txt` outputs as plain text
to `output/test/delete-a-realm.txt`.

In addition to converting the rST to plain text, this command removes
markup and things that would skew readability scores, such as code examples.
It also adds punctuation to titles and makes other small tweaks to things
that would otherwise falsely impact the readability score of the page text.

Usage Example:

```shell
node . getReadabilityText test/readability/delete-a-realm.txt --snootyTomlPath=test/readability/snooty.toml
```
